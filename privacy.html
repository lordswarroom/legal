  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2026-02-03</p>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>Quick summary (human-readable):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you sign in with Google, we store basic account info (UID, email, display name, photo) to recognize you.</li>
      <li>We store your language preference.</li>
      <li>Purchases/subscriptions are handled by Apple/Google; we use RevenueCat to verify premium access.</li>
      <li>Premium version is intended to be ad-free.</li>
      <li>We don’t sell your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Who controls your data</h2>
  <p>
    The data controller for this app is the app developer (“we”). For privacy questions:
    <br><strong>lordswarroom@gmail.com</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>2) What data we collect</h2>

  <h3>A) Account data (if you sign in)</h3>
  <p>
    Sign-in is optional unless a feature requires it. If you sign in via Google (Firebase Authentication),
    we may process and store:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase UID</strong> (unique user identifier)</li>
    <li><strong>Email</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Display name</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Profile photo URL</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Last login time</strong> (server timestamp)</li>
    <li><strong>Language</strong> (e.g. <code>en</code>, <code>hr</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B) App preferences</h3>
  <p>
    We store your language selection locally on your device (e.g., SharedPreferences) to remember your preferred language.
  </p>

  <h3>C) Purchases / subscriptions</h3>
  <p>If you purchase a subscription or in-app product:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments are processed by <strong>Apple App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play</strong>.</li>
    <li>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage and verify subscription entitlement status (e.g. “premium active”).</li>
    <li>We do not receive your full payment card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>D) Analytics and diagnostics</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, we do not use analytics or tracking tools for advertising purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may use diagnostics (such as crash reporting) in the future to improve app stability.
    If enabled, such tools may collect technical information like device model, OS version, and crash logs.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    If additional analytics or advertising tools are introduced, we will update this policy and request consent where required.
  </p>

  <h2>3) Why we process data (purposes)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide sign-in and account-related features.</li>
    <li>To store your settings (like language).</li>
    <li>To verify premium access and prevent entitlement errors.</li>
    <li>To validate daily feature limits and prevent abuse or fraud.</li>
    <li>To provide support if you contact us.</li>
    <li>To protect the app against abuse and keep it working reliably.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal bases (GDPR-friendly)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract / service delivery:</strong> to provide app features you request (sign-in, premium access).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> preventing abuse and ensuring the app works reliably.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> if we ever add optional analytics/ads where consent is required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Where data is stored</h2>
  <p>
    Account-related data may be stored and processed using Google Firebase services (Authentication and Firestore).
    Subscription status is verified via RevenueCat.
  </p>
  <p class="muted">
    These providers may process data on servers outside your country, including the United States,
    under appropriate safeguards.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Firebase App Check and server-side validation mechanisms
    to help prevent abuse, fraud, and unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2>6) Sharing of data</h2>
  <p>We share data only with service providers necessary to run the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Firestore)</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (subscription entitlement verification)</li>
    <li><strong>Apple / Google</strong> (payment processing handled by the platform store)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>We do not sell your personal data.</strong></p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The free version of the app may display advertisements.
    Premium (War Pass) access is intended to provide an ad-free experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    If ads are added, we may use advertising partners such as <strong>Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads)</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising partners may use device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID) to show ads and measure performance.</li>
    <li>Where required by law (EEA/UK), we will request consent before showing personalized ads.</li>
    <li>Users may receive non-personalized ads depending on region and settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="muted">
    If ads are introduced, this Privacy Policy will be updated and users may receive an in-app notice.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep account data as long as needed to provide the service.
    If you stop using the app, data may remain stored unless you request deletion.
    You can request account deletion at any time by contacting us.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data.
    In the EU/EEA, you have GDPR rights including data access and deletion requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    To request deletion or export, contact: <strong>lordswarroom@gmail.com</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>9) Children</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not intended for children under 13 (or under the age required in your country to consent to data processing).
    If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable safeguards and rely on trusted providers (Firebase/RevenueCat). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date reflects the latest version.
