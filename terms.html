  <h2>1) Fan-made / no affiliation</h2>
  <p>
    Lords War Room is a fan-made assistant app created by the community.
    It is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by IGG or Lords Mobile.
    All trademarks and game content belong to their respective owners.

  </p>

  <h2>3) The service we provide</h2>
  <p>
    The app provides informational and organizational tools (e.g., team suggestions, saved lists, language settings).
    Suggestions are based on community knowledge and may not be accurate in all cases.
  </p>

  <h2>4) No guarantees (important for “formation” features)</h2>
  <p>
    The app is provided “as is” and “as available.”
    We do not guarantee that any suggested formation, counter, or recommendation will work in-game.
    Results depend on many factors (stats, gear, buffs, lineup swaps, player decisions, and game updates).
  </p>

  <h2>5) User content and account</h2>
  <p>
    If you sign in, we associate your saved selections (such as owned heroes/familiars) with your account
    so you can access them across devices. You are responsible for keeping access to your account secure.

    <li>Use the app to distribute malware, spam, or harmful content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Premium features, purchases, and refunds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple App Store / Google Play.</li>
    <li>Premium access is verified via RevenueCat (entitlement status).</li>
    <li>Refunds are handled by the platform store (Apple/Google) according to their policies.</li>
    <li>Premium is intended to be ad-free. The free version may include ads in the future.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Changes to the app</h2>
  <p>
    We may update, modify, or remove features at any time, including adding new features or changing existing ones.
    Game meta can change; community recommendations may be updated or become outdated.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Termination</h2>

    We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe you are violating these Terms,

  <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special,

    Your use of the app is at your own risk.
  </p>
